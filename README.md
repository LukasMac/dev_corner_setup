# Dev Corner setup

1. Lunch local webserver:

 Those who want to use Ruby run `./bin/ruby.sh`
 
 Those who want to use NodeJs run `./bin/nodejs.sh`

2. Expose your local webserver so it would be reachable from outside `./bin/start_tunnel.sh`
3. Use your ngrok host to register for Dev corner's code challenge
